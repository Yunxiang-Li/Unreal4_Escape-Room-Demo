## Background
This is a very simple building escape game made by Unreal4 Game Engine according to the [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/)'s coursera course [Introduction to Game Development](https://www-cloudfront-alias.coursera.org/learn/game-development/home/welcome).

This game altogether has 2 levels. For each level, player needs to collect specific amount of scores(50 scores in both level) by shooting moving targets to win the level. Both levels have time limit, 15 seconds for level one and 10 seconds for level two. The player can shoot green targets to earn 5 scores each, shoot white targets to earn 3 seconds each and lose 3 seconds if shooting red targets.

Player can press wasd or arrow buttons to move, player can also press left mouse button or space button to shoot. If time is up then the game ends, player can shoot rotating buttons to restart, go to next level or play again.
